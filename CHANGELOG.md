# Changelog - PySerial GUI Project

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-08 - Device Tab Font Size Enhancement

### üé® UI Improvements
- **Increased Font Size**: Communication logs in Device tab now use 14pt font (up from 11pt)
  - Incoming Requests text box: 14pt Courier font for better readability
  - Outgoing Responses text box: 14pt Courier font for better readability
  - Header tags increased to 15pt bold for proper visual hierarchy
- **Better Visibility**: Larger text makes it easier to read protocol messages and debug communication

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-08 - Serial Reception Reliability Update

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed serial data reception issues**: Eliminated race conditions causing data loss
- **Improved packet reliability**: No longer requires sending data multiple times
- **Enhanced buffer management**: Consistent 4KB buffer for stable performance

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Faster response times**: Reduced read thread delay from 10ms to 5ms
- **Better GUI responsiveness**: Reduced GUI update interval from 50ms to 25ms  
- **Optimized polling**: Tab processing intervals reduced from 10ms to 5ms
- **Continuous polling strategy**: Always-on data reading prevents timing-based packet loss

### üîß Technical Changes
- **Serial Reading Strategy**: 
  - **Before**: `if self.serial_port.in_waiting > 0: data = self.serial_port.read(self.serial_port.in_waiting)`
  - **After**: `data = self.serial_port.read(4096)` with continuous polling
- **Thread Synchronization**: Better coordination between read thread and UI updates
- **Buffer Management**: Fixed 4KB buffer size for consistent performance

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new performance specifications
- Enhanced dev_note.md with detailed technical analysis of the fixes
- Added troubleshooting section for data reception issues

### üîß Layout Optimizations
- **Device Configuration**: Combined address/size into single row, reduced spinbox widths
- **Communication Logs**: Increased width from 30 to 45 characters, added expand capability
- **Statistics Display**: Standardized label widths with fixed alignment
- **Button Organization**: Optimized placement and sizing for better workflow

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-06 - UI/UX Enhancements

### üé® Interface Improvements
- **Window Size**: Increased from 800x600 to 1400x900 for better visibility
- **Font Size**: Upgraded from 9-12pt to 14pt for improved readability
- **Layout Optimization**: Single-line radio button layout for register operations
- **Minimum Size**: Added constraint (1200x800) to maintain usability

### üîå Port Detection
- **Virtual TTY Support**: Added detection for socat-created virtual ports
- **Cross-platform**: Enhanced port discovery for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Testing Support**: Improved development workflow with virtual port integration

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-05 - Protocol Implementation

### üöÄ Major Features Added
- **Host (Master) Mode**: Send register read/write commands with timeout handling
- **Device (Slave) Mode**: Simulate device with configurable register map
- **Custom Protocol**: Fletcher-16 checksum verification for data integrity
- **Error Simulation**: Configurable error injection for robust testing
- **Broadcast Support**: Device address 0 for broadcast messaging

### üîß Protocol Specifications
- **Packet Structure**: `[Start Flag|Device Addr|Message ID|Length|Data|Checksum]`
- **Function Codes**: Read/Write Single/Multiple (0x01-0x04) with responses (0x41-0x44)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes (0x81-0x84) with descriptive messages
- **Register Operations**: Support for 16-bit registers with address range validation

### üß™ Testing Infrastructure
- **Protocol Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `test_protocol.py`
